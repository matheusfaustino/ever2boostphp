# Ever2BoostPHP

We can say it's a port from https://github.com/BoostIO/ever2boost using PHP, however using consumer key and secret from Evernote API.

## Quick Start
For now, you need a consumerKey and consumerSecret from Evernote to be able to get your notes (I'm working on it).
```
$ git clone <repo>
$ cd ever2boostphp
$ composer install
$ ./app.php --consumerKey <key> --consumerSecret <secret> <boostnote_folder>
```
It will need your authorization and will try to open the url for it.
